# Integrating Knowledge Graphs with Multi-Modal Machine Learning (KG-MMML)

**Goal:** A reproducible framework for fusing Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with Multi-Modal ML (MMML) that preserves semantics, scales operationally, and explains outputs for open-world retrieval & zero-shot classification.

## ✨ Features
- **Multi-resolution semantics** (types → relations → k-hop → paths)
- **Hybrid retrieval**: graph spine + vector index + cache + stream
- **Honest evaluation**: accuracy + SRS + p95/p99 latency + robustness + rationale precision
- **Reproducible runs** driven by YAML configs
