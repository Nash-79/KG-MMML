# Abstract

Knowledge graphs provide rich semantic structure through explicit hierarchies and typed relations, but their query mechanisms struggle to scale beyond thousands of entities. Vector embeddings enable sub-millisecond retrieval through approximate nearest neighbour search, but compress structured knowledge into continuous representations that lose hierarchical and directional information. This tension between semantic preservation and operational performance has limited the deployment of knowledge graph-augmented machine learning systems in production environments.

This thesis introduces the Semantic Retention Score (SRS), a quantitative metric for measuring structural fidelity in hybrid knowledge graph-vector architectures. The metric combines four components—Hierarchy Presence (HP), Attribute Predictability (AtP), Asymmetry Preservation (AP), and Relation Type Fidelity (RTF)—weighted to reflect architectural priorities. The research evaluates a hybrid system on SEC EDGAR financial filings (N=3,218 documents, 47 US-GAAP concepts) using multi-label classification as the downstream task.

The system achieves SRS=0.8179, demonstrating 81.79% semantic retention whilst maintaining 0.037ms p99 retrieval latency—a 4,054× margin over the 150ms service-level objective. Classification performance improves +1.36 percentage points in micro-F1 and +2.27 percentage points in macro-F1 over text-only baselines, with particular benefit for rare classes. Pattern-based taxonomy generation produces 1,891 is-a edges without manual annotation, increasing HP from 1.15% to 27.26%. Robustness testing under taxonomy removal and unit-noise perturbations quantifies architectural dependencies invisible in accuracy-only evaluation.

The research contributes: (1) the SRS metric for quantifying semantic preservation, (2) pattern-based taxonomy generation as a scalable alternative to manual annotation, (3) characterisation of ceiling effects in high-accuracy classification regimes, (4) an honest evaluation framework incorporating robustness and scalability alongside accuracy, and (5) empirical evidence that simple KG-as-features approaches outperform complex joint training for specific use cases. The findings inform architectural decisions for practitioners deploying hybrid systems in production environments.
