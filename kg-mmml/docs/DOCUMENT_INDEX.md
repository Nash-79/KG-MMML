# Document Index

This index standardises document ownership and removes ambiguity about what to cite.

## Canonical Documents (Current)

- `Architecture.md` - Canonical architecture definition and final metric interpretation
- `../../README.md` - Repository entry point and canonical status summary
- `../DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` - Implementation and workflow guide
- `DOCUMENTATION_STANDARDS.md` - Documentation writing and citation standards
- `Glossary.md` - Canonical terminology

## Milestone and Progress Documents (Historical Snapshot)

- No active milestone snapshots are stored under `docs/` in the current trimmed structure.

## Archived Documents (Archived)

- `archive/` - Superseded configs, outputs, and historical report snapshots

## External Source Extracts (External source extract)

- No external source extract directory is currently retained in this repository snapshot.

## Citation Rule

If a claim appears in more than one file, cite the highest-priority document from the canonical
list above. Use milestone or archive files only when explicitly describing historical evolution.
